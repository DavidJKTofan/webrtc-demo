# Stream and playback live video over WebRTC with Cloudflare Stream

Follow [this guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/webrtc-beta) to get started.

You can run and edit this code in Stackblitz using the links below:

- [Stream live using WHIP & WHEP, playback in real-time using WHEP in the same window.](https://workers.new/stream/webrtc)

# Live Demo

First, set up and change the WHIP and WHEP URLs with their private keys.

_Note: the URL keys are meant to be private._

Connect the Repository to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

Start the live stream on: [WHIP](https://webrtc-demo.pages.dev/whip)
And by activating "Live Playback and Recording" on the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/stream/inputs).

Watch the live stream on: [WHEP](https://webrtc-demo.pages.dev/whep)

_Note: I might start the live stream at random times, so it might not show anything most of the time._
